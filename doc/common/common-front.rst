About |product name|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| enables customers to link their corporate identity
systems to Rackspace to let their employees use their regular company
credentials to authenticate to Rackspace accounts.  Authentication occurs
using the industry standard `SAML 2.0 <http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html>`_ protocol.

|product name| is supported for users of Rackspace Cloud and Fanatical
Support for AWS. Dedicated Hosting accounts are not currently
supported, although the feature will be enhanced to include all customers
in the future.


Benefits of using |product name| include:

- Customers can control their account security policies using existing
  systems
- Less need to manually create new users in the Rackspace portal
- :ref:`Attribute Mapping <attribmapping-basics-ug>` allows dynamic
  privileges assignments based on user attributes provided during the
  login process
