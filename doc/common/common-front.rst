About |product name|
====================

|service| enables customers to link their corporate identity
systems to Rackspace to let their employees use their regular company
credentials to authenticate to Rackspace accounts.  Authentication occurs
by using the industry standard
`Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 <http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html>`_
protocol.

|product name| is supported for users of Rackspace Cloud and Fanatical
Support for AWS. Although the feature will be enhanced to include all customers
in the future, dedicated Hosting accounts are not currently supported.


Using |product name| provides the following benefits:

- Customers can control their account security policies by using existing
  systems
- Less need to manually create new users in the Rackspace portal
- :ref:`Attribute Mapping <attribmapping-basics-ug>` enables dynamic
  privileges assignments based on user attributes that are provided during the
  login process
