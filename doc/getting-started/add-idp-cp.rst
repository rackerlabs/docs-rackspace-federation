Adding an Identity Provider in the Control Panel
================================================

To add an |idp|, log in to your Rackspace control panel by browsing to
https://login.rackspace.com.

1. Click on your username in the upper right area of the navigation bar, and
   select **User Management** from the dropdown menu. Alternately, browse
   directly to to the `Account Management <https://account.rackspace.com/>`_ page in the Rackspace Control Panel.

2. Choose the **Identity Federation** tab at the top of the page.


3. Click the **Add Identity Provider** button.

Basic Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each |idp| should have a unique **Description** and **Login Domain**.

   * - Item
     - Description
   * - Description
     - Provide a description for your |idp|. This is the description will
       show in lists and other areas in the Control Panel.
   * - Login Domain
     - Provide a valid email domain, such as *mycompany.com*. Users will
       provide their email address during the federated login process, and
       their email domain will be used to identify which |idp| they should
       be redirected to to complete logging in.

Uploading SAML Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, you will need to upload an XML file containing required metadata to
complete the setup of your |idp|. Most identity systems have a method for
generating this metadata file automatically, or after some basic configuration
has been completed.

See the section :ref:`index-configuring-3p-saml-ug` for general
and provider specific guidance on configuring your identity system and
retrieving your metadata XML file.


When your XML file is attached, click the **Create Identity Provider** button
to complete the process.
