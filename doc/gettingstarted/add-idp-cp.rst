   * - Item
     - Description
   * - Description
     - Provides a description for your |idp|. This description appears in
       lists and other areas in the Control Panel.
   * - Email Domains
     - Provides a valid email domain, such as **mycompany.com**. Users provide
       their email address during the federated login process, and the process
       uses their email domain to identify and redirect them to the correct
       |idp| to complete the login process.

Add an |idp|
------------

Cloud customers use the following steps to add an |idp|:

1. Log in to the `Rackspace Customer Portal <https://login.rackspace.com>`_.

2. In the upper-right area of the navigation bar, select
   **Account > User Management** from the drop-down menu. Alternately, browse
   directly to the `User Management <https://account.rackspace.com/users>`_
   page in the Rackspace Account Management Control Panel.

3. In the sub-navigation bar, select **Identity Federation**.

4. Click **Add Identity Provider**.

5. Provide a short description of the |idp| for organizational purposes. When
   users log in by using federation, they see the name provided here.

6. Click **Add Domain**, enter the email domain with which users should
   authenticate and click **Add**.

7. Within the **SAML Metadata** section,locate and click the **No file chosen**
   button. Choose the metadata file you downloaded from your |idp|. The
   :ref:`Okta metadata file<okta-metadata>` shows an example of this file.

After your |idp| metadata is successfully uploaded, you are now ready to begin
:ref:`mapping policy attributes<config-attribute-mapping-ug>`.
