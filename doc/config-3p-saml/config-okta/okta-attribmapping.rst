==========================
Attribute Mapping for Okta
==========================

If you want the groups a user belongs to appear in the SAML attributes and
assertions sent to Rackspace so they can be mapped into permissions, you may
need to customize the group attribute statements Okta uses to include group
membership. You can do this while configuring the SAML application in the
**Group Attribute Statements** or edit an existing
application by going to your Admin panel and modifying the
**Group Attribute Statements**.

For example, if you want to include all groups a user belongs to which have the
word ``rackspace`` in your SAML assertions, add a field with an appropriate
name like ``groups`` and select a regex filter with the value
``.*rackspace.*``.

The following is an example Rackspace YAML ``.yml`` attribute mapping policy
that you can use when you configure your identity provider with Rackspace. This
example assumes you have a group named ``rackspace-billing`` with users you
want to access Rackspace billing services using the ``billing:admin`` Rackspace
role.

Notes:

- The ``groups`` specified in the example should be changed to match your
  configured Okta groups.
- Remember to update *at a minimum* the ``domain`` value to your Identity
  Domain from the |idp| details page.
- Validate that any values being mapped to ``email`` and ``expire`` are
  properly specified for your specific SAML attributes/assertions. For example,
  in policy below, ``email`` is being set using the ``path``/``"{Pt}`` syntax
  in the |amp| language to point to the ``NameID`` attribute in the SAML
  assertion.

             # This would configure a maximum session duration of 4 hours, you may wish to set this to a SAML provided value
             name: "{D}"
             # This value will match to the SAML attribute "name" by default.
             roles:
               - "{0}"
         remote:
           -
             multiValue: true
             path: |
                 (
                   if (mapping:get-attributes'groups')='rackspace-billing')then    'billing:admin' else ()
                 )
             # The groups specified here are examples. You should substitute your own groups
     version: RAX-1

Be sure to validate and modify the following items in your own policy |amp|:

- The Okta groups users belong to that you want to map to specific Rackspace
  permissions.
- The ``expire`` value/path
- The ``email`` value/path
