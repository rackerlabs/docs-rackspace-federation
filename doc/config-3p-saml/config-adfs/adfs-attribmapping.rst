Attribute mapping for ADFS
--------------------------

The normal method for mapping ADFS users to Rackspace roles or permissions is
to use ADFS Groups. This guide gives an example of setting up your |amp| to
send both the ADFS Groups to which users belong and user information as SAML
assertions for proper mapping.


Use the following steps for ADFS attribute mapping:

1. Go to the **Claim rules** for the Rackspace relying-party trust that you
set up.

2. Add a new rule for the **LDAP Attribute** named
**Token-Groups - Unqualified Names** with an **Outgoing Claim Type** of
**Group**.

To learn more about customizing how you include Active Directory group
membership in your SAML attributes, see

<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff359101.aspx>`_

The following example shows a Rackspace YAML (``.yml``) attribute mapping
policy that you can use when you configure your identity provider with
Rackspace. This example assumes that you have a group named
``rackspace-billing`` with users that you want to access Rackspace billing
services by using the ``billing:admin`` Rackspace role.

Notes:

- You should change the ``groups`` specified in the example to match your
  configured outgoing claim type for the active directory groups.
- At a minimum, remember to update the example's ``domain`` value to your
  Identity Domain, which is found on the |idp| details page.
- Validate that any values that are mapped to ``email`` and ``expire`` are
  properly specified for your specific SAML attributes or assertions. For
  example, in the following example policy, ``email`` is set by using the
  *path* (``"{Pt}"``) syntax in the |amp| language to point to the ``NameID``
  attribute in the SAML assertion.

                value: "{Ats(http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/Group)}"
          user:
             domain: "your_domain_id_goes_here"
             # Update to your Identity Domain from the Identity Provider details page
             email: "{Pt(/saml2p:Response/saml2:Assertion/saml2:Subject/saml2:NameID)}"
             expire: PT4H
             # This would configure a maximum session duration of 4 hours, you may wish to set this to a SAML provided value
             name: "{D}"
             # This value will match to the SAML attribute "name" by default.
             roles:
              - "{0}"
              # This substitution states to take the value of the return from the first element of the remote role
         remote:
           - multiValue: true
             path: |
                 (
                   if (mapping:get-attributes('http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/Group')='rackspace-billing')then    'billing:admin' else ()
                 )
             # The groups specified here are examples. You should substitute your own groups


Be sure to validate and modify the following items in your own |amp|:

- The **Active Directory** groups that users belong to and to which you want to
  map specific Rackspace permissions.
- The ``expire`` value/path
- The ``email`` value/path
