Managing Identity Providers
===========================

.. note::

    It is recommended to use the Control Panel to mange Identity Providers, but
    advanced users may choose to use the Rackspace Identity API instead.

    To use the API to create and manage your Identity Providers, see the
    `Identity Providers <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-identity/v2/api-reference/identity-provider-operations/>`_
    section of the `Rackspace Identity API Reference
    <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-identity/v2/api-reference/>`_.


Basic Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~

Manage your Identity Providers via the Rackspace Control Panel at
`https://accounts.rackspace.com/users <https://accounts.rackspace.com/users>`_.
You can take actions to manage your |idp| through either the list of
Identity Providers on the **Identity Federation** page, or through
the **Actions** menu on the details page for any |idp|.

Updating Metadata and Certificates

To update key details about your |idp|, use the  **Update Metadata**
button in the Control Panel. The following will be extracted and updated
from your metadata:

- the security certificate

Updating your metadata will not change the **Login Domain** or **Description**
