Overview
========

The |service| enables you to link your corporate identity system to Rackspace.
This lets your employees use their regular company credentials to authenticate
to Rackspace accounts, reducing the number of logins and passwords they need
to manage.

Using |product name| provides the following benefits:

- You can control your account security policies by using existing
  systems.
- There's less need to manually create new users in the MyRackspace portal.
- :ref:`Attribute Mapping <config-am-policy-gs-ug>` enables dynamic
  privileges assignments based on user attributes that are provided during the
  login process.

You configure SAML providers and authentication by using the industry standard
`Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 <http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html>`_
protocol.
